# Getting Stated TypeScrpt https://www.typescriptlang.org/

#JavaScript
  * The key difference is: JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at run time);
  * TypeScipt uses "static types"(set during development);
  *********************************************************

* In TypesScprit, you work with types like string or number all the times.
* Important: it is string and number NOT String, Number
* The cor primitve types in TypeScript are all lowercase!

# To use TypeScript



* run npm install -g typescript(The -g is to install it globali in the computer)
* run tsc  and the name of the file, and it will compile it to javaScript.
* tsc nome do app e -watch, this way the file will compile automatic for one file.
* tsc --init is for a complitly project. 
* once tsc init runned, all i need is to run tsc or tsc -w to watch for changes.

* run npm init
* npm install --save-dev lite-server :  for a live server
