# Getting Stated TypeScrpt https://www.typescriptlang.org/

#JavaScript
  * The key difference is: JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at run time);
  * TypeScipt uses "static types"(set during development);
  *********************************************************

* In TypesScprit, you work with types like string or number all the times.
* Important: it is string and number NOT String, Number
* The cor primitve types in TypeScript are all lowercase!
